## Examples

### Node.js

#### [Sockets](Node.js/sockets)

A whole NestJS module with entities,UWebsocketAdapter and gateway(Redis used as a transport).

### React Native

#### [Live Activity](React-Native/Live-Activity)

A React Native example demonstrating iOS Live Activity implementation, showcasing real-time updates and dynamic island support on iOS devices.

## How to Extend

1. Create a new folder for code samples you want to add respecting existing hierarchical structure.
2. Add a new entry to [Examples](#examples) section using a template below with a brief description of the new code
   samples.
3. Add a new entry to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) section with a link to the new code samples.
